There are numerous tools out there to help make your work easier, such as internal tools. But what are they for? Why do you need them? And can you use them effectively to improve your business\'s performance and operate more efficiently?\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe answer is Yes! And that\'s one of the reasons for building Hadmean, a modern no-code, internal tool generator. Developers tend not to enjoy building internal tools as they are boring and too repetitive. With Hadmean, building admin interfaces and internal apps becomes extremely easy and more importantly fun. However, before delving into all the exciting features and offerings of Hadmean, let us briefly understand internal tools.\\n\\n## What are internal\xa0tools?\\nInternal tools, also known as admin interfaces, internal software, admin panels, internal apps, admin dashboards, or employee tools, are software created to perform administrative tasks in an organization. These are generally purpose-built to fit an organization\'s internal operations and processes. They range from data visualization dashboards and CRUD interfaces to your data, lead management systems, and customer support tools.\\n\\nInternal tools are incredibly vital, and developers invest significant time in developing internal tools, admin panels, and systems for back-office operations to automate and speed up essential business functions. It includes several efforts, ranging from database maintenance to creating various front-end and back-end codes. But what if you could utilize a modern tool to build such applications that help to ease the burden of your work? Sounds good, right? Let\'s look at how you can also create internal tools that enable business agility.\\n## What is\xa0Hadmean?\\n[Hadmean](https://github.com/hadmean/hadmean) is an open-source, no-code software that generates admin dashboards, internal apps, and admin panels based on your existing database information. It is fully featured and extremely customizable.\\n\\n## Why Hadmean?\\nMost internal tool generators make you build from the ground up i.e you get a blank canvas then you are asked to drag and drop components, and wire them together to satisfy your business requirement. This I believe has many problems.\\n- They require technical know-how.\\n- They require some learning curve.\\n- They require time to build and maintain.\\n- You duplicate a lot of business logic already in your database.\\n\\nHadmean approaches internal tool generation by introspecting your database and building a multi-page application according to all the info it can find, like your field types, relationships, constraints, etc. No JavaScript or SQL is needed to get a fully working application.\\n\\n## Features\\nBelow are some of the top-rated features of Hadmean that make it the best platform for internal tool generation.\\n\\n**Easy to install:** Hadmean has one of the easiest installation processes for such a robust tool.
