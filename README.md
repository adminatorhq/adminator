## About
Hadmean is an admin app generator. 

It generates powerful internal tools in seconds with just one command, no learning curve, no technical skills and finally zero maintenance.

Hadmean will help you focus your engineering resources on building exciting features and not building and maintaining admin dashboards.

### Demo
https://demo.hadmean.com is an example admin app generated with zero programming knowledge.

### Features Walkthrough Video

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/J43YtoSPFRw/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/J43YtoSPFRw)


### Motivation
Most internal tool generators make you build from the ground up i.e you get a blank canvas, drag and drop components, and wire them together with SQL and Javascript/Python to satisfy your business requirement. This I believe has many problems.

- They require some technical know-how. 
- They require some learning curve. 
- They require time to build and maintain. 
- You duplicate a lot of business logic already in your database.

Hadmean attempts internal tool generation with a new approach by introspecting your database and building a multi-page application based on all the info it can find like your field types, relationships, constraints etc. You literally can have your admin app done under 1 minute without any tutorial or coding.
